Now I will show you what about this simulator(Random text)
```
his tool was created because we wanted random text for our web designs. When we show a design to a client we want to have some text that doesn't mean anything in particular just to indicate that "here is where the text will be". So why shouldn't we just copy-paste a single sentence and get a block of text ? Have a look at the following examples:

This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text.
This is a single sentence repeated a few times.

Is post each that just leaf no. He connection interested so we an sympathize advantages. To said is it shed want do. Occasional middletons everything so to. Have spot part for his quit may. Enable it is square my an regard. Often merit stuff first oh up hills as he.
And this is some text from our generator.

As you can easily notice the second block of text looks more realistic. This way when you show a design to a client you can have a result that resembles the final product. However you can also use this text when you need meaningless text in the background of a design for a poster, t-shirt or whatever else you please.

Why not use lorem ipsum ?
Lorem ipsum is the most common form of "Greeking". However more and more people are sick and tired of using the same sample text over and over again. Also lorem ipsum is in latin and it may not always be the best choice. We tried to have text generated in some of the most widely used languages but if you are in desperate need of random text in your own language, send us an email and we'll add it here.

I love it, how can I help ?
It's easy. Tell a friend about us or if you are super kind place a link to us in your website or blog. Thank you :)
